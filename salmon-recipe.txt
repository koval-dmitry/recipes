Ingredients:
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 dried red chile pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon whole grain mustard
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- sea salt to taste
- freshly ground black pepper
- 2 (6 ounce) fillets salmon

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a medium baking dish with aluminum foil. Lightly grease foil.

2. With a mortar and pestle, grind together the garlic, chile pepper, and olive oil. Mix into a thick paste with the mustard, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Place the salmon fillets in the prepared baking dish, and coat with the paste mixture.

3. Bake salmon 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.

Tip:
Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.
